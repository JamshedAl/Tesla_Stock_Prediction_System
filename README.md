# Tesla_Stock_Prediction_System
 Trained models on extensive stock market dataset, incorporating real-time Tesla data for accurate insights on trends, volatility, and factors impacting stock prices.
Our project involved training the models on a comprehensive dataset encompassing the past year's stock market information. We gathered real-time data directly from the official Tesla website, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the input. By incorporating various features and indicators, we aimed to capture market trends, volatility, and other essential factors influencing stock prices.
Throughout the project, we implemented ARIMA, a widely used time series forecasting model, to analyze the sequential nature of the data and capture seasonality, trends, and stationarity. Additionally, we leveraged the robust capabilities of Facebook Prophet, an open-source forecasting library, to model non-linear growth patterns, holiday effects, and other key factors impacting Tesla's stock prices.
